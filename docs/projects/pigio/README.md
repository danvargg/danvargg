A deep learning eye-tracking system for [Innodem Neurosciences](https://innodemneurosciences.com/) to help patients communicate using only eye movements.

The system powers both the [Pigio™: Gaze-to-Speech](
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pigio-gaze-to-speech/id1399641303) and the [Pigio™ ICU: Gaze-to-Speech](
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pigio-icu-gaze-to-speech/id1466945385) applications.
These Software-as-a-Medical-Device (SaaMD) applications allow Intensive Care Unit patients (conscious but intubated or paralyzed) to communicate through eye movements.
