## Data Science Training Program

Developed and facilitated a comprehensive data science training program for a team of 9 data analysts, covering topics 
ranging from data extraction to model deployment, resulting in a significant increase in team members' technical 
proficiency and ability to deliver results.

Coached and mentored data science projects, providing guidance and expert advise to ensure that business results were 
achieved. 

Developed all program materials, including code, presentations, assignments, and projects, resulting in a cohesive and 
effective training program that met the needs of the team and the organization. This also included setup for `Azure` 
infrastructure for sessions and projects.

This program was built for [Master Data Analysis](https://www.linkedin.com/company/master-data-analysis/).
