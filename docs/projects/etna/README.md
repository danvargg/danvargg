A deep learning eye-tracking system for [Innodem Neurosciences](https://innodemneurosciences.com/) to aid with the 
evaluation and monitoring of neurological disorders. The system powers the [ETNA-NDHC-MS](
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/etna-ndhc-ms/id1575499467) mobile application. 
This project is an iteration of the [Deep Learning System for Eye Gaze Tracking](
https://github.com/danvargg/danvargg/blob/main/docs/projects/pigio/README.md) project.

The `ETNA-NDHC-MS` mobile application is designed to record eye movements in healthy control participants during visual 
tests presented on the iPad to help investigate the link between eye movements and disease progression in patients with 
Multiple Sclerosis (MS). To do so, the application makes use of `Innodem Neurosciences'` patented eye-tracking technology 
using the iPad's camera.

### Business Problem

The goal was to develop a system that could record patients' eye movements during visual tests presented on screen. 
The system had to be able to run in real-time on the iPad, providing precise predictions for eye movement signal 
processing and analysis.

### Implementation

#### 1. Data Collection and Processing

### Business Results

The deep learning system allowed the business to record precise eye movements in real-time during every visual test 
presented on screen. The business was able to acquire precise eye movement signals to evaluate and monitor neurological 
disorders over time.
