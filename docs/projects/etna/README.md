> This a generalized version of the project. The specific code, architecture, and data are property of the client and cannot be fully shared.

A deep learning eye-tracking system for [Innodem Neurosciences](https://innodemneurosciences.com/) to aid with the 
evaluation and monitoring of neurological disorders.

The system powers the [ETNA-NDHC-MS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/etna-ndhc-ms/id1575499467) application.


Change:

The ETNA-NDHC-MS application is specifically designed for use in research-ethics-board (REB)-approved clinical studies 
where only approved study personnel and participants who have signed an REB-approved consent form will be able to use 
the application via a unique identifier code. The application is designed to record eye movements in healthy control 
participants during visual tests presented on the iPad to help investigate the link between eye movements and disease 
progression in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). To do so, the application makes use of Innodem Neurosciences' 
patented eye-tracking technology using the iPad's camera. The data collected by this application are being used to 
validate the application and its underlying algorithms within the context of REB-approved clinical studies. No data is 
currently being used to provide medical guidance to patients and/or medical professionals, and the application itself 
will not provide the user with any clinical or medical information following the completion of the visual tests.

### Business Problem

TBD.

### Business Results

The deep learning system allowed the business to improve the performance of its eye  tracking technology to a level 
that is comparable or better than existing infrared solutions.
